## About The Project 
Author: Bekhruz Malikov

Stanford University, Class of 2027

Project: XGBoost For Ultra-Low Latency Trading 

Major problem: Machine Learning/Deep Learning with Python is slow given that it is one of the slowest compiled languages but with modern 
learning methods, it is becoming most useful for its simplicity to implement. XGBoost is one algo-example. 

Solution: I implement XGBoost learning in Python and do the rest of the inferencing on a simple FPGA. This predicts and executes trades decisions much faster(hypoth.)  

July 2025 - Present 

## Built With 

Python 

Verilog/SystemVerilog

GoBoard FPGA
